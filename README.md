## Explore a Relational Database - SQL
I used SQL to explore Sakila Movie database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions (chosen by myself) about the database.

The final result of the project consists of 4 business-related questions. Each question:

* Has a question of business interest;
* Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question (see *queries.sql*);
* Has a supporting visual representation that answers  questions of interest (see *SQL_Project.pdf*).

The four questions of business interest that I developed are:

* Is there any seasonality for Family
friendly movies?
* What are the 10 longest movies featuring the most best
selling actor?
